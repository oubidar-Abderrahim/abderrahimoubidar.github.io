Greetings!

My name is Abderrahim OUBIDAR, a passionate Java developer from Morocco. 

The main reason for my blog is to share the cool stuff that i learn with you. but also to gather some of the best articles i find online in one place, that's why at the beginning most of my articles will be sort of remake of other articles i read.

So, if you love programming I hope you'll find some of my posts interesting. enjoy! :)

Thank you!
